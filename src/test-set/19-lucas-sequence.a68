This program is part of the Algol 68 Genie test set.

A small selection of the Algol 68 Genie regression test set is distributed 
with Algol 68 Genie. The purpose of those programs is to perform some checks 
to judge whether A68G behaves as expected.
None of these programs should end ungraciously with for instance an 
addressing fault.

@section Synopsis

Lucas sequence and the golden ratio.

The Lucas sequence has the same recursive relationship as the Fibonacci sequence. 
The ratio of successive terms approaches the golden ratio, the terms themselves being 
roundings of integer powers of the golden ratio. Two numbers are in the golden ratio
if their ratio equals the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two numbers:

  (a + b) / a = a / b, with a > b > 0.

   determine first generation:
      LONG INT previous := 1, current := 3.

   can represent next generation:
      current <= long max int - previous.

   calculate next generation:
      LONG INT new = current + previous;
      previous := current;
      current := new.

   print next generation:
      print ((current, newline, previous, new line, current / previous, new line, new line)).
