This program is part of the Algol 68 Genie test set.

A small selection of the Algol 68 Genie regression test set is distributed 
with Algol 68 Genie. The purpose of those programs is to perform some checks 
to judge whether A68G behaves as expected.
None of these programs should end ungraciously with for instance an 
addressing fault.
