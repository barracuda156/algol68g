This program is part of the Algol 68 Genie test set.

A small selection of the Algol 68 Genie regression test set is distributed 
with Algol 68 Genie. The purpose of those programs is to perform some checks 
to judge whether A68G behaves as expected.
None of these programs should end ungraciously with for instance an 
addressing fault.

COMMENT
This example computes Fibonacci numbers by counting the number of derivations of the 
"Fibonacci grammar":

  fib: "a"; 
       "a", fib; 
       "aa", fib.

The purpose is to illustrate the use of procedure closures which we call continuations.
We use this to generate a recursive descent with backup parser following a simple translation 
from grammar rules to procedures.
This program was contributed by Eric Voss and simplified/modified by Erwin Koning and 
Marcel van der Veer.

           terminal (i, "aa", s, (INT j) VOID: grammar fib (j, s, q))
     END;
